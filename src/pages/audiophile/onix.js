        The Shanling ONIX XI1 is a high-end DAC/AMP featuring a dual Cirrus Logic CS43198 DAC chipset, supporting PCM 32-bit/768kHz and DSD256 for clean, detailed, and natural sound. Powered by dual SGM8262 amplifiers, it delivers up to 500mW@32Ω via the balanced 4.4mm output, driving a wide range of headphones with ease. Its compact design includes a 0.87” OLED display and physical controls for convenient operation. With both 3.5mm and 4.4mm outputs, Eddict Player App support, and optimized low power consumption, the XI1 is a perfect choice for audiophiles on the go.

      <P>
        Today I want to share my thoughts on their latest dongle, the Shanling Onix Alpha XI1. Although it is branded as Onix, it is essentially a Shanling product. In my personal opinion, the XI1 is significantly better than the UA5/4/3 models.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        Compared to its predecessors, the Onix XI1 is noticeably larger, resembling a "chubby" dongle. However, it has a more attractive and premium appearance, arguably the best in its price range. The metal casing feels quite thick, giving it a heavier feel compared to other dongles.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The surface is textured, which helps resist scratches and reduces fingerprints. However, there is a small glossy area on the front that requires careful handling to avoid scratches. The back features a faux leather design that looks quite nice, while the sides are designed with ventilation slits.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The glossy center houses a small hidden display, and the gold buttons are used for volume control (which can also be assigned to skip tracks). The other gold button is for play/pause (press and hold to access the settings menu). Surrounding the play/pause button is an LED light strip.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The display shows information such as volume level, gain settings, active filter, assigned button functions, operating mode, and the audio format being processed. After a certain period, the display will switch to standby mode, featuring a music note animation.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The settings menu includes nine customizable options: Gain adjustment (Low/High), Filter selection (five options including NOS), button function customization (volume control separate from the source, track skipping), font selection (eight fonts), L/R channel balance, screen brightness, main screen timeout, screen rotation, and standby screen timeout.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        Overall, the Onix XI1's settings menu is similar to that of the UA4, with the only difference being the addition of the NOS filter. The XI1 is also compatible with the Shanling app on mobile devices for easier adjustments.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        Before discussing sound quality, I want to address the compatibility issues with the Onix XI1. Currently, I am using a secondary device, the Samsung A52, and the XI1 does not work with it when using a C-to-C cable (both stock and fast charging cables). It only functions when I use the iBasso CB19 power splitter and connect it to a power bank. Switching to the A54 yields the same issue. It only works normally with my main device, the S23+, using a C-to-C cable.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The dongle operates normally when connected to a laptop via a C-to-A cable. It also works with the iBasso Lightning cable on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. However, it does not function with the Samsung devices using a standard Type-C cable. I have not tested it with other Android devices, so I cannot confirm if they have similar issues. Therefore, I recommend testing compatibility before purchasing.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The XI1 has a powerful output, especially when using the balanced output, but it requires an external power bank or connection to a laptop to reach full capacity.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        In terms of sound quality, the Onix XI1 has a neutral sound signature with a slight warmth, serving as an upgrade from the UA4. The tonal quality of the XI1 is more pleasant and natural compared to the UA5, comparable to higher-end models like the M15, CDA-M2, and W2.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        While the UA4 also has a neutral sound, pairing it with bright or neutral-bright headphones can result in a slightly harsh upper midrange. The UA5, while detailed, lacks a natural tonal quality, with some upper midrange sections being harsher than the UA4. The XI1 does not have these issues; its tonal quality is very natural and slightly analog, especially when using the NOS filter, making it very enjoyable and versatile for various music genres.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The bass is well-balanced and adequately enhanced, with a good distribution between sub-bass and mid-bass without excessive emphasis like the Shio. This prevents the bass from sounding bloated when paired with warm-sounding headphones or those with inherent bass.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The sub-bass extends nicely, while the mid-bass is full and warm without feeling hollow, unlike the Moonriver 2 Ti. The bass has added resolution, with a well-paced response (not too fast or slow, though changing filters can slightly affect the bass response speed). The bass texture is relatively well-defined and rounded. Pairing the EA1000 with the XI1 results in beautifully rendered bass.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        Unlike the UA5/4/3, the XI1 has a natural, smooth, and emotionally rich midrange. The low midrange is thick and warm, but in a balanced way—not overly warm or heavy. If you need more warmth and emotional depth for male vocals, the XI1 excels in this area.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The upper midrange is quite detailed, though not as detailed as the Moonriver 2 Ti (and even less so than the Link2 Bal). However, I find the level of detail in the upper midrange sufficient, as excessive detail can be detrimental. When paired with the River 2 Ti, the upper midrange can become harsh and too forward. The midrange is slightly pushed forward, making vocals prominent without being too close to the ear, unlike the DC06/DC06 Pro or River 2 Ti.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        Instrumental sounds are smooth, with a tendency to round out tones without being overly sharp, especially for violins and guitars. The cello sounds particularly pleasing. The treble of the XI1 may not be the most detailed among current dongles, but it is smooth, comfortable, and non-fatiguing, even when paired with bright-sounding headphones. The soundstage is adequately expansive, enough to satisfy my preferences.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        The soundstage of the XI1 leans slightly towards depth, with width and height being moderate. The soundstage is relatively multi-dimensional, but to achieve better balance, it should be paired with headphones that have a wider soundstage. This will enhance the multi-dimensionality. The imaging is precise, with good accuracy and clear separation between vocals, instruments, and background sounds, rivaling the DC03 Pro.
      </P>
      <br></br>
      <P>
        Overall, the Onix XI1 is versatile and can pair well with any headphones. The only minor drawback is that it consumes a bit of power. If it had been released 2-3 years ago, it would have dominated the sub-3 million segment. Unfortunately, it launched during a time when the dongle market was somewhat saturated, so it hasn't gained as much recognition. Nevertheless, it is an excellent product worth investing in.
